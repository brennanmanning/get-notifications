# Get Notifications

A minimal React Native app built with [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo). Eventually, you can just type an activity you want to be reminded about and how often you want to be reminded to do it. Then, you will get notifications telling you to do whatever activity you want to do.

## TODO

- [ ] Add in the notifications
- [ ] Add ability to easily delete notifications
- [ ] Allow for multiple notifications
- [ ] Add another page to track activities
- [ ] Add a time picker for daily activities
